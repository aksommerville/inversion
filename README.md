# Inversion

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

2026-01-01. For Uplifting Jam #6, theme "CHANGE/TRANSITION".

Single-screen platformer where you can change the environment three ways:
 - Bonk the ceiling to reverse gravity.
 - Duck on a corner to rotate gravity.
 - Press the wall to floop inside of it, and reverse solid/passable.
