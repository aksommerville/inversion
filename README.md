# Inversion

Requires [Egg v2](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg2) to build.

2026-01-01. For Uplifting Jam #6, theme "CHANGE/TRANSITION".

Single-screen platformer where you can change the environment three ways:
 - Bonk the ceiling to reverse gravity.
 - Duck on a corner to rotate gravity.
 - Press the wall to floop inside of it, and reverse solid/passable.
 
## TODO

- [ ] Animate walking and jumping.
- [ ] Gravity rotation.
- [ ] Wall inversion.
- [ ] Goal.
- [ ] Gravity feels a bit floaty. Tighten up.
- [ ] Hazards.
- [ ] Almost impossible to enter a 1-meter horizontal gap. Should we account for that in the hero's hitbox? Or just avoid in design?
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Music.
- [ ] Revise graphics. I've been inconsistent about outlines, and not sure what I prefer.
- [ ] Hello modal.
- [ ] Gameover modal.
- [ ] Scorekeeping.
- [ ] Itch page.
